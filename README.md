This project exposes a source code editor (Scintilla) to Eto.Forms applications as a Control.

**Eto.Forms** is a GUI toolkit which can be used to build applications that run across multiple platforms using their native toolkit, with an easy to use API. It currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac, and GTK#.

**Scintilla** is a free source code editing component. It comes with complete source code and a license that permits use in any free project or commercial product.

This project follows Eto conventions for adding custom platform-specific controls. Read [this](https://github.com/picoe/Eto/wiki/Custom-Platform-Controls) for more information.
